		<p>Hello. This is a blog of some sorts. Here is where you can see me post about various things that interest me.
		 Examples include projects I'm working on, cool things I'm learning, subjects I feel like ranting about, and more. 
		 If this is your first time here, please check out the about me section as well as any other areas that intrigue you. You 
		 can see detailed descriptions of my projects under the projects tab. I also keep my posts consolidated under the articles tab.</p>
		<p>I don't know how often I'll be able to update this, but I'll try to post frequently. This new semester is going to be quite hectic,
		 	which is good since I'll have a lot to write about, but bad because I won't have much time to write. </p>
