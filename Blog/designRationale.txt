This website is designed for anyone interested in me (including myself). The look of the site is intended to be simple and easy to navigate. Information is laid out without too many distractions. The cadet blue background and lack of background image sets a quiet, natural tone to the site. Images reflect my interests (lightning cat!).  Visitors probably want to know more about me, so the site’s feel and content reflect my personality– quiet, appreciation of nature, a sense of humor – and interests. The navigation bar is easily identified at the top of every page, without obscuring the page’s content.  
PHP is used several times in the website. It displays the navigation bar on every page. If I need to change the bar, I need only change the PHP once and not the code on every page. PHP also handles form inputs, often for sending messages. It checks if inputs are valid – for example, I defined a function to check if an e-mail is a valid Cornell e-mail. The extensive use of PHP to simplify development and implement form validation, as well as the use of pattern matching for e-mail addresses, earns my site a WOW factor.
