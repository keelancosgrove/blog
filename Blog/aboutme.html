	<h1 class="intro">About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a junior at Cornell University double majoring in computer science and mathematics. I expect to graduate in May 2017.
	 After graduation, I would like to take a position as a software or data engineer.
	  I was born in Toronto, but have lived in Fairfield, Connecticut for most of my life. 
	  My hobbies include reading - particularly historical fiction, science, and psychology - lifting, hiking, snowboarding, coding, and more.
	   The future of technology excites me, and I want to develop smarter algorithms to handle the massive amounts of data modern applications utilize. 
	   I'm constantly learning, whether it's through new technologies, travelling, reading, or some other medium.
	    As far as athletics go, I'm focusing on increasing strength with side focuses on cardio, mobility, and martial arts.
